# ATM-Simulation-Java
A Beginner Friendly Java Project for ATM simulation
Description:
A console-based Java application simulating core ATM functionalities: PIN verification, balance checking, deposit, withdrawal, PIN change, mini statement, and exit. Designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (encapsulation, abstraction), exception handling, and transaction management for a single-user banking system. Ideal for students and developers learning Java and banking logic.

Features:
Secure PIN verification with 3 attempts.
Check account balance.
Deposit and withdraw funds with input validation.
Change PIN securely.
View mini statement of recent transactions.
User-friendly text-based menu with exit option.

Objectives:
Showcase OOP principles like encapsulation (private fields for balance, PIN) and abstraction (simplified method interfaces).
Implement robust exception handling for invalid inputs.
Simulate real-world ATM operations for educational purposes.
